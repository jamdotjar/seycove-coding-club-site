# **What is Python?**

- **High-level**, **interpreted** programming language
- Developed by Guido van Rossum, first released in 1991
- Emphasis on readability
- Widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more

# **Why Python?**
With the plethora of programming languages available and new ones emerging regularly, so why chose python?
Python has the following advantages:
- **Huge Community:** Python has a large and active community of developers. This means that for almost any problem you encounter, someone else has probably run into it as well.
- **Packages:** Python has a rich set of libraries and frameworks that can help you in almost every task. Whether it's web development, data analysis, machine learning, or game development, there's a Python package for that.

- **Simple:** Python has very simple syntax, that is easily readable by humans. This becomes very obvious when compared to other langages such as Java, or C++.

---

# **Advantages of Python**

- **Readability:** Clear and easy-to-understand syntax
- **Efficiency:** Write less code to accomplish tasks
- **Flexibility:** Supports multiple programming paradigms
- **Extensive Libraries:** Vast standard libraries and third-party modules

# **Readability: Clear and easy-to-understand syntax**

Python's syntax is designed to be readable and straightforward, which makes it a great language for beginners. A simple "Hello, World!" program in Python, C++, and Java:

**Java:**

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

**C++:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
---
# **Python:**

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
- Is much simple,
- Bascially english
- Good for beginners
---

# **Efficiency: Write less code to accomplish tasks**

Python is a high-level language, which means you can accomplish more with less code. This leads to faster development times and less room for errors.

Factortial example:

---
# **Java**
```java 
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(factorial(5));  // Output: 120
    }

    public static int factorial(int n) {
        if (n == 0) {
            return 1;
        } else {
            return n * factorial(n - 1);
        }
    }
}
```
---
# **Python**
```python 
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

print(factorial(5))
```

# **Flexibility: Python is like a Swiss Army Knife**

Python is a flexible language that can be used in many different ways. You can think of it like a Swiss Army Knife for coding. It's great for simple tasks, but also powerful enough for big projects.

---

# **Extensive Libraries: Vast standard libraries and third-party modules**

Python has a rich set of libraries and modules that can help you accomplish almost any programming task. From web development to data analysis, machine learning, and game development, there's a Python package for that.

---
# **Disadvantages of Python**

- **Speed:** Slower than some languages like C, C++, or Rust
- **Mobile Development:** Not the best choice for mobile applications
- **Memory Consumption:** Can be high compared to other languages, it's like the Chrome of programming languages

---
# **Getting Started with Python**

1. **Installation:** Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
2. **IDEs:** Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm or VSCode
3. **Practice:** Start with simple projects and exercises
4. **Resources:** Utilize online tutorials, books, and community forums
